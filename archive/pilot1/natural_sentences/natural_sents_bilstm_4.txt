They went to judgment at the same moment
If you are married you have no choice
You do this all the time in business
It had nothing to do with my enjoyment
We are all in the same boat now
They wrote that they should not be surprised
I hope you find someone to talk to
You may have to put on a front
I really like this album as a whole
But this argument can not be taken seriously
I thought at first that he was intoxicated
He gave up his work as a guide
There were four of them on his heels
I probably played with them for a year
I am all here and more than here
I never had a chance like this before
There is nothing more in life for me
It was the most heartbreaking moment for me
He tried to speak lightly on his side
But I feel that we must do something
I also asked him not to tell anyone
I will be giving it to her today
This is just all wrong in my experience
This is exactly why I like this sub
But then he started calling all the time
Of course you will come home with me
They will help you to build the city
So we got out of there at midnight
It was his friend who took his money
I never intended to come back to Korea
It is in the hands of my solicitor
A lot of us can identify with it
Do not try to do everything at once
They were out of sight in a minute
I never told my family about that night
I can not really change for the better
I shall go to bed in ten minutes
He stood up and attempted to deny it
I tried getting my friend into the game
I got it from the bank this morning
I talked to my best friend in private
Our response is the fastest in the world
And we want to know about your women
The process is expected to take several years
I am disappointed by your lack of imagination
Sitting in the back of a cop car
So it was my freshman year of college
We set out a great deal too late
She knew she needed to make a change
And there is the sacrifice to be made
I could easily hang with any of them
It was as sudden as it was overwhelming
She was the second daughter of her parents
That was supposed to be a temporary arrangement
But I found a lot of things positive
It was all very bright and very small
All this I have done for your sake
And yet let him take care of me
He was pretty much grounded all the time
I am a man who can love well
