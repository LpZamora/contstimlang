# how to generate controversial stimuli

Use the file **make_contstim** to generate controversial sentence pairs. There are two versions of this file â€“ a python notebook and a python script. Both should work. There are three arguments that need to be hardcoded at the top of the scripts: i) model1, model2, and squashing_threshold.
