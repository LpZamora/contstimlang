Its like they see you in slow motion
She held the paper aloft in her hand
He just bought something an hour before hand
This is one way of avoiding hearing loss
So naturally you guys have to defend yourselves
The men with her were less than nothing
You need to probably cut down that tree
All of this will eventually impact the organs
What to eat and drink when you exercise
Her action was followed by an impressive silence
Though I do suspect what it could be
Otherwise he is liable to get into mischief
I am in despair at our persistent ignorance
And of course steroids are a big issue
He would never walk or hold his baby
The use of them involves no possible error
Another feature in the campaign also impressed me
I thought nobody would ever beat that record
To my surprise she actually said she would
But at first I felt no pain whatever
She could not sleep for her waking dreams
The dental screening that could save your life
These athletes are more celebrities than anything else
Manga is really cool because of the diversity
Got a second one and it works perfectly
The old man was now between two fires
He ceased to sleep either day or night
But it does make his character more believable
Both had seen the footprint in the sand
We need good music on the radio again
More practice for next time it comes up
You are as cool and soft as snow
But I am interested in cars and gadgets
Its steady hand was pointed to the head
He had arrived that afternoon from Central America
This was evidently a sad afternoon for them
Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean
You can do it alone without anybody knowing
She had been and her throat was slit
No idea what their plans for us were
Life should be nothing short of an adventure
George does not seem to care for cathedrals
Some come just to play games after school
And they hardly are speaking with one voice
I have witnessed fights over this very thing
Critical reaction has been positive towards the song
It has no chorus in the conventional sense
Artists tend to be kind of emotional people
And his chains fell off from his hands
All the top men set a great example
We proceeded to draw on cars with rocks
We pick up literally where we left off
The sky above them was full of mythology
In the battle four men ran away together
They played their games at the Victoria Arena
Someone willing to enjoy themselves in any situation
Each segment contains a pair of two legs
The couple wrote a blog throughout their trip
I could have better spared a better man
But John has not contributed to my campaign
