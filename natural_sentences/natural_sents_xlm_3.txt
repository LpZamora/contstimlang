Its gotten me a lot in this life
The same could be said of climate change
No one said I was using them literally
I suppose he is afraid of a scandal
How I got there I had no recollection
The time was yet to come for independence
No one knows his real name or past
Wake up the next morning and text her
I worked there from August to late December
Do not trust a single word they say
Going out on a limb on this one
Modern life had done all this for her
He had no trouble looking for the article
But now they are all estranged from me
They wanted the heat in the second round
What is happening in Syria is no exception
This is an edited transcript of the interview
His thoughts were of the beautiful white girl
But you should always keep it by you
I need you bad as bad can be
The episode received mildly positive reviews from critics
Save that good stuff for the second half
It is the sign of a true sportsman
The origin of the political division is unknown
And then one day their car breaks down
I should note that I have a bias
I had not the slightest inclination to sleep
Do not make up your mind too suddenly
It shows that the odds can be beaten
I see no reason to harp on this
But his friends could not believe the news
I waited until they were completely around me
Many fires have been caused in that way
It would just sit lower in the water
Every single thing I said he agreed with
He started in surprise when he saw her
Could have been bad luck on our part
You are already far ahead of the curve
This is probably what I find most annoying
You had full control of the whole computer
So they would not pretend to be glad
The tale would be the same as mine
You are not there to service the couple
She won an Academy Award for the role
She did not have details about the arrests
I take the full responsibility for this proceeding
She moved a step forward in the darkness
So that being done I went to bed
Some friends came once and never came back
I freaked out and started to go inside
She had not been fit to marry anybody
The date had a special interest for me
The situation may be the same in mathematics
I used to really like the pepper boy
The girl had listened to him in silence
There the landlord spoke for the first time
Not for me and not for most fans
People need to just be open to change
Neither could I find any trace of her
They were to go there on a coach
